    "\n",
    "Recommendation Systems apply IR (Information Retrieval techniques) to select some information relevant to a given user. __Collaborative Filtering (CF)__ is currently most widely used approach to build recommendation systems and uses the users’ behavior in form of user-item ratings for predictions. CF often uses __Matrix Factorization (MF)__ under the hood. In this lesson, we will look at an overview on the role of the Matrix Factorization model to address the implementation of CF with __Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand collaborative filtering and how it differs from other simpler approaches \n",
    "- Describe the problem of developing a recommendation system using matrix factorization\n",
    "- Develop an intuition around how SIngular Value Decomposition can be used to predict unknown values in a utility matrix\n",
    "- Practice SVD in python and SciPy"

    "In more general terms, collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (i.e. filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users on the aggregate (i.e. collaborating). \n",
    "\n",
    "__The key idea behind Collaborative Filtering is that similar users share similar interests and that users tend to like items that are similar to one another__.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this may not be completely true on every occasion, if we have a large enough dataset, if there are patterns present, they will start to emerge.\n",
    "Assume there are some users who have bought certain items, we can use a matrix with size $num_users*num_items$ to denote the past behavior of users. Each cell in the matrix represents the associated opinion that a user holds. For instance, $M_{i, j}$ denotes how user $i$ likes item $j$. Such matrix is called __Utility Matrix__, as the example shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get table from other notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "___CF is filling the blank (cell) in the utility matrix that a user has not seen/rated before based on the similarity between users or items___. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users' opinions can be explicit or implicit as we saw earlier. Explicit opinion is more straight-forward than the implicit one as we do not need to guess its meaning. For instance, there can be a movie that a user would likes very much. A user's watching behavior (implicit indicates) might indicate that a user watched the full movie without pauses, but he could actually be busy doing something else while the movie was playing. Without explicit opinion (i.e. a rating/stars), we cannot be sure whether the user dislikes that item or not. However, most of the feedback that we collect from users are implicit. Thus, handling implicit feedback properly is very important too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Above image shows an example of predicting of the user's rating using collaborative filtering. At first, people rate different items (like videos, images, games). After that, the system is making predictions about user's rating for an item, which the user hasn't rated yet. These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. For instance, in our case the system has made a prediction, that the active user won't like the video.[WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)\n",

The basic difference is that memory-based algorithms use all the data all the time to make predictions, whereas model-based algorithms use the data to learn/train a model which can later be used to make predictions. This means that the memory-based algorithms generally should have all data in memory, whereas model-based can make fast predictions using less data than the original (once you build the model).
